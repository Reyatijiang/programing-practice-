Here’s my code from various courses work and other programing practice. 

An integer number is said to be abundant if the sum of its proper divisors, including 1 (but not the number itself) 
are greater than the number. For example, 24 is abundant, because the proper divisors of 24 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 12. 
The sum of those proper divisors is 36, which is larger than 24. The “abundance” of 24 is (36-24) = 12.

This is a program that generate all the odd abudant number under 10,000.
